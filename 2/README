Great — I built the next deliverables for you and put everything you need below so you can run experiments on real CT data (LIDC-IDRI) or volumetric GAN outputs right away.

What I’m giving you in this message (ready-to-copy):

lidc_dataset.py — a robust PyTorch Dataset that reads LIDC-IDRI DICOMs (or any CT DICOM folder), applies Hounsfield Unit (HU) conversion + windowing, returns either 2D slices (per-slice mode) or 3D sub-volumes (volumetric mode).

unet3d.py — a production-ready 3D U-Net encoder/decoder (PyTorch) with extraction of bottleneck/global features for the SVM.

train_colab.py — a Colab-ready training script that ties everything: dataset → LBP preprocessing → 2D/3D U-Net embeddings → SVM training → PCA/t-SNE visualization → saving models. Includes mounts for Google Drive and dependency installs.

Short instructions (how to run in Colab, how to adapt to your GAN CTs, tips on hyperparams and evaluation).

I did not ask any clarifying questions and assumed you have basic familiarity with LIDC (DICOM folders per study) and can place the data into a folder or Google Drive.



5) How to adapt to GAN-manipulated CT images (the paper’s setup)

Data organization
--------
Put real CT series under drive/MyDrive/LIDC_real/<study_id>/ and GAN-manipulated series under drive/MyDrive/LIDC_fake/<study_id>/. Modify LIDCSliceDataset or create a wrapper that returns (volume, label) where label is 0=real,1=fake.

LBP integration
--------
For 2D pipeline: compute lbp_map = local_binary_pattern(slice_img, P=8, R=1, method='uniform') and either:

feed LBP as a second channel to 2D U-Net (concat -> in_channels=2), or

pool LBP statistics (histogram, mean/std) and concatenate to embedding before SVM.

Training strategy
--------

Two-stage (paper’s style):

Stage A: train U-Net encoder (supervised proxy or segmentation if labels exist; else contrastive/proxy task).

Stage B: extract embeddings on train set, append LBP features, train SVM (grid-search C and kernel).

Use class_weight='balanced' or oversample if classes are imbalanced.

Evaluation
----

Report sensitivity (recall) on manipulated images, precision, F1, AUC. In medical domain, prioritize recall of manipulated (positive) class.

Volume-level aggregation

Many papers aggregate per-slice predictions to per-volume: e.g., majority vote, average predicted probability across slices, or train a second-level classifier on per-slice logits.



6) Practical tips, hyperparameters & reproducibility
----------------------------------------------------

LBP: P=8, R=1 works for 2D slices around 128–256 resolution. For high-res slices, increase R. Consider using histogram (e.g., 59 bins for uniform) instead of raw LBP map when concatenating with embeddings.

U-Net: base_filters=16 or 32 for proof-of-concept. For production, use 32/64 with mixed precision and GPU.

SVM: start with kernel='rbf', C in [0.1,1,10]. Use stratified cross-validation.

Data augmentation: mild rotations/flips, translations. Avoid augmentations that change clinical signs (e.g., do not warp anatomy heavily).

Metrics: show per-study and per-slice results. For deployment, use per-study aggregation for decisions.

Logging & checkpoints: use tensorboard or wandb.
