Done — I packaged everything and created a downloadable ZIP containing:

unet2d.py — 2D U-Net (encoder + embedding)

synthetic_dataset.py — synthetic 2D medical-like dataset (real vs fake)

train_2d.py — end-to-end 2D pipeline (proxy train encoder → extract embeddings → train SVM)

optuna_search.py — Optuna example for SVM hyperparameter tuning (uses synthetic data)

gan_detection_notebook.ipynb — Colab-friendly notebook that runs the demo

README.md — quick usage notes

Download the package here: Download gan_medical_pipeline.zip

Next suggestions (pick any, I’ll do immediately):

I can run the demo here and show the training logs & evaluation (on the synthetic dataset) and attach the resulting model files.

I can convert the Colab notebook to a richer notebook with visualization cells (loss curves, embedding PCA/t-SNE, confusion matrix).

I can produce a LIDC-ready Dataset wrapper (DICOM reader + HU windowing + labeling helper) and integrate it into the notebook so it’s plug-and-play with LIDC-IDRI.

I can run the Optuna search now (on the synthetic data) and show best hyperparameters and plots.

Which of these would you like next?



# GAN-Manipulated Medical Image Detection (LBP + U-Net + SVM)

This project implements the approach from **A. S. & S. Narayan (2024, AMATHE)**  
using Local Binary Patterns (LBP) preprocessing, U-Net feature extraction, and an SVM classifier.

---

## Components
- **synthetic_dataset.py** → creates a toy medical-like dataset (real vs fake).
- **unet2d.py** → 2D U-Net model for embedding extraction.
- **train_2d.py** → training pipeline (U-Net + embeddings + SVM).
- **optuna_search.py** → Optuna tuning for SVM.
- **gan_detection_notebook.ipynb** → notebook demo (Google Colab friendly).

---

## Usage

1. Install dependencies:
pip install torch torchvision scikit-learn scikit-image optuna matplotlib

2. Run synthetic demo training:
python train_2d.py

3. Tune SVM with Optuna:
python optuna_search.py

4. Open Colab Notebook:
jupyter notebook gan_detection_notebook.ipynb

5. Upload the notbook to Google Colab, and just run the cells.
You’ll get:
U-Net training on synthetic medical-like images
Embedding extraction
SVM classification with precision/recall/F1 report
Visualization of sample “Real vs Fake” images

----------
Save this JSON as gan_detection_notebook.ipynb, upload it to Google Colab, and just run the cells.
You’ll get:

U-Net training on synthetic medical-like images

Embedding extraction

SVM classification with precision/recall/F1 report

Visualization of sample “Real vs Fake” images

Do you also want me to extend this notebook with:

t-SNE/PCA plots of the learned embeddings,

Optuna tuning loop for SVM hyperparameters, and

A confusion matrix heatmap for results?
