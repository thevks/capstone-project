Perfect ðŸ‘Œ â€” hereâ€™s a full PyTorch implementation of the CNN-based End-to-End Forgery Classifier for GAN-manipulated CT scans.

Itâ€™s a simpler and faster pipeline than the dual-stream or U-Net+SVM method:

Directly trains a pretrained CNN (EfficientNet/ResNet/DenseNet).

Multi-class classification (TB, TM, FB, FM).

Includes DICOM/PNG loader, augmentations, training loop, evaluation, and Grad-CAM explainability


How it works
-----------

Dataset

Load CT scans (.dcm, .png, .jpg)

Apply augmentation during training (flips, rotations, brightness jitter).

Inference uses only normalization.

Model

Uses EfficientNet-B0 backbone (via timm) with classification head â†’ 4 classes.

You can swap with "resnet50", "densenet121", "efficientnet_b3", etc.

Training

Loss: CrossEntropy.

Optimizer: AdamW.

Early-stops on best validation accuracy.

Evaluation

Prints accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix.

Computes Grad-CAM heatmap for explainability.

âœ… Why this is better than the U-Net+SVM paper approach?

End-to-end â†’ no handcrafted LBP.

Transfer learning â†’ faster convergence, higher accuracy.

Simpler pipeline â†’ easier to deploy in real PACS/telemedicine settings.

Explainable via Grad-CAM.

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to also provide a Keras/TensorFlow 2.x version of this CNN classifier, or will PyTorch be enough for your project?
