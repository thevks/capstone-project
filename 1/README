Nice — I’ll give you a complete, working implementation you can run locally that follows the paper’s pipeline: LBP preprocessing → U-Net feature extractor → SVM classifier.
The code is ready to plug into real datasets (e.g., LIDC-IDRI and your GAN-generated CTs), and also includes a small synthetic-data example so you can sanity-check the pipeline right away.

I’ll provide:

A single Python script (PyTorch + scikit-learn) with everything: data handling, LBP, U-Net, training loop, feature extraction, SVM training, evaluation, and save/load.

Instructions for dependencies and how to adapt to real datasets.

Notes & tips for reproducing results close to the paper.


What this implements
----------

LBP (Local Binary Patterns) preprocessing (using skimage) to extract texture maps from input images.

A U-Net encoder/decoder (PyTorch) adapted so we can extract a feature vector (from encoder bottleneck or global pooled decoder features).

A pipeline that concatenates LBP features + U-Net embeddings, then trains an SVM (scikit-learn) to classify real vs GAN-manipulated images.

Save/restore model & a small synthetic dataset trainer for immediate testing.

Install these (tested on Linux/macOS/Windows; Python 3.9+ recommended):

python -m pip install torch torchvision scikit-learn scikit-image numpy tqdm pillow


(If you want GPU support, install the correct torch wheel from https://pytorch.org.)
